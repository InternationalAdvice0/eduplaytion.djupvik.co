            <h1>Our vision</h1>
            <p>For many students, the subjects at the school are first and foremost things to be pegged, and not something that is fun
            and interesting. Eduplaytion stands for learning through play and mastery, and wants students to discover and
            understand the meaning and purpose of what they do.
            </p>
            <p>To develop our solutions, we have brought together people of different backgrounds and nationalities, but with one
            common vision: to create entertaining gaming experiences that awaken the curiosity and learning will of children and
            adolescents.

                    the areas of improvement in the school gradually become clear. Now I want to contribute my knowledge

                    the game's target audience is children, it is very important that you see it all from our point of

                    more entertaining, fun
                    and interesting. I like to play myself, and have learned a lot from games that I would not have

                    play it. We children
                    know what is fun and what is not. I think it is exciting to learn and play at the same time, and
                    it's especially fun to
                    upgrade the fun characters in the game as we get further. It motivates. "</p>

                    also like that there
                    is so much light and color in the surrounding environment, and that you can get your own figure that
